Thanks for meeting on such short notice. I've been reviewing the latest quarterly reports, and I think there's a real opportunity brewing in the renewable energy sector. Solar stocks took a dip recently due to regulatory uncertainty, but the fundamentals are still strong. I’m thinking about increasing our position in SunGrid Technologies—what’s your take?

I’ve noticed that too. The dip looks like a reaction to short-term news, not long-term performance. SunGrid’s expansion into Southeast Asia is promising, and their last earnings call showed better-than-expected margins. But I’m a bit cautious—did you see the recent spike in raw material costs? That might squeeze their Q4.

That's a fair point. But I’ve been comparing them to their competitors, and SunGrid seems better positioned to weather those costs. They locked in long-term supply contracts earlier this year. That could give them a pricing advantage going forward. We could hedge a bit by also looking into battery storage companies—something like VoltCore.

VoltCore is interesting. I met with their CFO last week—solid leadership, clear growth roadmap. Their R&D spending is high, but they’ve been converting that into patents and partnerships. We’d need to weigh the higher risk with the potential for long-term gains. I’d say it’s worth a small entry position for now.

Agreed. We can scale based on performance. On a separate note, how do you feel about our current exposure to tech? We’ve trimmed back on the big names, but I’m still seeing value in mid-cap AI firms—particularly those focused on enterprise solutions rather than consumer-facing apps.

Exactly where I was leaning. Consumer tech is volatile right now, but enterprise software is proving more stable. I’ve been watching NeuralSys—they specialize in machine learning infrastructure for logistics firms. Their client retention rate is over 90%, and they just signed a deal with a major shipping company. Could be worth a deeper dive.

Let’s schedule a call with their investor relations team next week. If everything checks out, we can make a modest allocation and monitor from there. Also, let’s not forget to review our real estate holdings next meeting—I’m hearing some chatter about zoning law changes that might affect our commercial properties downtown.

Good call. I’ll gather some notes and bring updates to the table. For now, I’ll start drafting proposals for the SunGrid and VoltCore plays, and we’ll circle back midweek to finalize allocation.

Sounds good. Let’s keep everything flexible for now and move swiftly if the window starts to close. I’ll talk to our analyst about preparing a risk report in the meantime.
